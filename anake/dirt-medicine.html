						<p>Sit spot is one of the routines I was most looking forward to in Anake.
Strangely it’s also one of the ones that would have been on the easier side to
pick up and start doing on my own. How hard can it be to go and just sit in the
woods? Sit spot as a routine has been in my awareness for a few years and yet
I’ve never done it intentionally more than a handful of times. It’s actually
really hard. Not sitting in the woods -- that’s easy -- I love sitting in the
woods. But for whatever reason, <em>deciding</em> to go sit in the woods is <em>really</em> hard.</p>
<p>Sit spot is the core routine of core routines. Though I’ve felt drawn to it for
a while and heard many times that it’s the bees knees, it’s been a mystery to me
how something so simple could be supposedly so transformative. I’m gonna go out
on a limb and say I think I might be beginning to understand the magic.</p>
<p>I struggled early on with finding a spot. It felt like a big commitment. I’m
gonna go sit in this spot for 9 months. Dang. It better be perfect. We have a
lake (pond?) less than 100 yards from our house in Duvall. It’s got ducks,
geese, a heron, lots of small birds, raccoons, coyote sign, deer sign, and
probably more. It’s teeming with life. Perfect right? My sit spot is not there.
Instead, my sit spot is a 10 minute walk (or 30 minute fox walk) away. Why oh
why did I choose that? I’ve asked myself that frequently.</p>
<p>My primary expectation around the sit spot routine was that it would be a place
to watch and see exciting wildlife. I had the pond as my sit spot for the first
week and was generally excited by the wildlife. But what has become clearer to
me, and what was in the beginning unconsciously clear, is that my sit spot had
to be a place of healing. The dynamics of my spot on the pond and neighbourhood
feel were not (for me) conducive to healing.</p>
<p>So I up and moved. This was the part that I struggled with because you’re not
“supposed” to move your spot. For a little while I went to both spots unsure
whether I wanted to commit to the wildlife on the pond or the strange new place
I had found. At about three weeks into the program I ran into some emotions
that were calling for more resources than I had at my immediate disposal. I
took the only reasonable course of action and leaving the house headed without
thinking for my sit spot. It wasn’t the one on the pond.</p>
<p>My sit spot is in a strip of forest sandwiched between two housing
developments. Its entrance is a short dirt road up a hill lined with Salmon
Berry, Big Leaf Maple, Black Cottonwood, and Alder. In the late afternoon of a
fall day it’s breathtakingly beautiful. At the end of the dirt road is a
roundabout where I head up into the forest. I think it’s an old second growth
forest. The canopy is Cedar and Doug Fir and Big Leaf Maple. For me, old trees
like this have an astounding sense of belonging, a sense of hereness that is
impossible to ignore. The understory is mostly Sword Fern woven throughout the
trees and scattered Oregon Grape. And, perhaps most importantly, the fallen
trees and stumps. These ghostly remnants of the past are both a monument to
what was here before and the bed from which the new things grow. The place
smells dank. Musky earth and decomposing wood. The line between the living and
the deading is blurred.</p>
<p>This is the place where I internalize what I learn on class days. It has
frequently been where I meet a new kind of being for the first time. And it’s
where I am for the first time in my adult life developing ongoing relationships
with non-human beings (trees and dirt and ferns and the like). I love the
rotting log that I sit on and the young Cedar that stands next to me. I’m
learning to love the rain.</p>
<p>I’ve known for some time that my energy is recharged the most by being immersed
in nature. This is the first time I’ve successfully had a practice where the
intention is just that. And that says a lot.</p>
