						<hr/>
						
						<p>One hand goes down into the dirt.  The leaves are soft and wet and rotting.  Are they covering a twig? Thankfully, no.  I move my body forward, adding pressure to that hand and it sinks further into the dank earth.  I pause, frozen, maybe for a full minute, maybe for 3 seconds, maybe for an hour.  Then I bring my knee up along my body and place it in the impression that my hand had been previously.  It sinks in and cracks a twig.  Shit.  I pause again, listening intently hard to nothing in particular.  A doug squirrel is making an awful racket in a nearby tree.  He was supposed to be my sentry to let me know if anyone was coming up through the south, but it seems now he’s letting me know that I’m here.</p>
<p>I’m trying really hard to bring myself into a flow state so I can move extremely quietly through the woods.  It’s not working.  We’re about 30 minutes into a game of capture the flag.  I’m currently “guarding” our flag.  My clothing is shades of mottled green and my face is streaked with mud and soot.  My shirt has homemade fringe running down the arms.  Supposedly I’m camouflaged, but I feel as visible as a hot pink air balloon in crisp blue sky.  And I feel immobilized because of it.</p>
<p>It’s a strange fear that’s come over me.  I don’t immediately understand it, but it’s a fear of the ego.  Capture the flag was my jam when I was a kid.  I remember vividly the anticipation around the huge games of capture the flag I played at summer camp every year.  I lived for those games.  I do not recall being a hot pink air balloon when I was playing those games.  I recall being a quick and scrappy invisible ninja.</p>
<p>Maybe I just need to do a sit spot and sense meditation until I really become one with this forest, then I’ll be able to move again like a scrappy ninja.  It takes a painfully slow three minutes to (hopefully) silently maneuver myself into the cross-legged sitting position necessary for my upcoming zen-like sit spot.  Once there I start to relax.  Ahhh, this is more like it.  I’m completely silent, not making one iota of noise.  The doug squirrel is still making noise though, still pewing away from his lofty perch, shouting out my location loud and clear.</p>
<p>Why am I even here? What am I doing?  We’re playing on twenty acres, does anyone on the other teams have any idea where our flag is? Probably not.  Months go by and the doug squirrel goes quiet.  I could sit here for the next several months practicing my sit spot or I could venture out and see what becomes of me.</p>
<p>In this version of capture the flag there is no safe zone.  You can tag or be tagged anywhere.  Whoever sees the other one first within fifteen feet gets the tag.  More like a war zone where if you&#39;re seen you&#39;re shot dead.  So staying hidden is of paramount importance.  It seems the only way to stay hidden is to remain completely still.  But then I don’t get to practice my scout moves or have any of the exciting challenge of trying to grab an opposing teams flag.  Grrrrr, this is driving me bonkers.  I can’t move without risking being seen.  And being seen feels like death or an unacceptable blow to my ego.</p>
<p>Eventually I determine that this is not a game of sit spot and that I must head out into the great unknown, risk life and limb, and go capture a flag.  I’ve made a wild guess that with four teams there is a flag in each of the four corners of the twenty acre arena.  There’s very little hope of moving quietly through the salmon berry in the middle of arena so I decide to take the trail that goes up along the edge.</p>
<p>It takes me probably at least a half hour to go the 20 yards to the trail.  Sometimes stepping over sword ferns and oregon grape, but frequently worming my way under.  Every bit of friction between myself and a plant sounds like nails on a chalk board.  I’m still petrified of being seen.  I wait, lying low at the edge of the trail.  I’m guessing the trail has others moving along it which I’ll have to be careful to avoid.  Worse though, I’m guessing there are others hiding along the edges of the trail that I’ll have very little chance of seeing.</p>
<p>I hear a noise from off the trail.  Could be a human.  I wait for a long time and then hear the rustle again.  Probably Ron, one of my teammates, but I don’t have anyway of knowing for sure without giving myself away.  I wait for a long time before I move out onto the trail.  Off trail I can likely keep myself in pretty hidden positions in the shrubbery.  Being on the trail is a very different level of exposure.  I wait and wait and wait, continuing to not feel able to let myself into that level of risk.</p>
<p>Eventually I realize that if I want to move I have to let go of my expectation that I will be the one who is unseen.  There is risk intrinsic to the act of moving up this trail.  As hard as I might try I cannot actually remove that risk.  I can’t even manage it to a level in line with my expectations.  I have to accept a higher level of risk.  I have to be okay with being seen.  I have to be okay with losing the game.</p>
<p>As I come to this realization I feel a weight lift.  I have a choice.  I can choose to remain motionless, as completely hidden as possible, and wait for others to come to me or not.  The most cautious route.  Or I can choose to play the game the way I feel my body wants to play it -- like a scrappy ninja.  And I may live, or I may die.</p>
<p>And so I stepped into the path.</p>
<p>I didn’t end up finding the flag where I thought it may be.  I did have a number of encounters with other scouts.  Some I saw first, and some saw me first.  Some I danced with from afar sometimes knowing where they were and sometimes not.  I moved slowly, but I moved.  I even had a couple moments where I felt like a scrappy ninja, and really, what more can you ask for?</p>
