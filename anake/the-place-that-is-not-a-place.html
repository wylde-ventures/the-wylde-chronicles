						<p>I’m sitting in a van.  </p>
<p>When I look to the left or right I can see rolling wooded pastures reminiscent of rural New England passing by the windows.  That’s strange, I think to myself.  I thought we were driving through the San Joaquin Valley in central California.</p>
<p>When I look down I can clearly see my right hand resting on my knee.  That’s strange, I think to myself.  I can clearly feel that my hands are clasped together and resting between my legs.</p>
<p>When I look straight ahead I can see the road moving away from us and disappearing out in the horizon like I’m sitting in the rear facing seat of a station wagon.  That’s strange, I think to myself.  I’m quite certain I’m facing forward in a van that is driving forward.</p>
<p>I’m a few hours into a 24-hour blindfold challenge. I’m experiencing very clear vision behind my blindfold.  I’m finding it disturbingly close to what I know of the “actual reality” but not quite the same.  It’s an uncanny valley that I’m not crossing.</p>
<p>I can hear the hum of the wheels on the pavement.  I can hear the engine rev up as it drops into a lower gear.  I can feel how the mass of my body moves and pushes against itself in various ways as we speed up, slow down, turn corners, or go over bumps.</p>
<p>I can hear the conversation in the van.  Occasionally someone hands me a random piece of food to try, which I try with mild trepidation.  Yum, sesame sticks.  I can occasionally smell manure when someone opens a window.</p>
<p>I can’t always tell when people are talking to me unless they use my name.  I attempt to join into conversations occasionally, though I generally feel awkward doing it.  I realize I don’t know if someone pausing in their speech means they are just pausing and considering their next words or if they are waiting for a response from me.</p>
<p>I feel slightly uncomfortable and vulnerable.  I don’t bring any of this up.  I feel okay with watching my own reactions to this experience and continuing to let it unfold.</p>
<p>I don’t realize the relative comfort of the van until I leave it.  We pull into a rest area along the highway.  I don’t want to sit in the van while everyone else embraces the precious 15 minutes of freedom from the vans.  I also don’t want to aimlessly wander about in a parking lot next to a freeway.</p>
<p>I’m helped in the initially correct direction out of the parking lot towards the heart of the rest area.</p>
<p>Our group tends to have some pretty high energy when we are unleashed from the vans.  We’re a group more tuned for running around in the woods than sitting in vans.  Earlier in the trip we were asked if we were from Cirque Du Soleil (we’re not).</p>
<p>A few people are likely falling asleep in the grass.  More are likely crawling around on all fours in cougar form.  Some are likely vaulting over picnic tables and practicing acro yoga.  One is walking around blindfolded.</p>
<p>I’m headed across the parking lot (I suppose).  I’m moving with the flow of released energy and voices from my tribe.</p>
<p>One of those voices tells me to head right.  As I start to head right Melissa tells me not to listen to that voice because there’s a parked car to my right.  The voice chuckles.  I pause, unsure of my trust in those around me.  I grow more keenly aware of my vulnerability.</p>
<p>I knew I was likely to be messed with at least a little bit during this experience.  This is, indeed, a high energy, fun loving, edge pushing group.  It feels different now though.  The dependency on others is real.</p>
<p>I’m out of the parking lot and my guardian Melissa heads off to the bathroom.  A friend leads me to a patch of grass near where I can hear people filling up water bottles.  I sit down.  He asks me if I’ll be okay there for a bit.  I have no idea but I answer in the affirmative.</p>
<p>I don’t seem to be very near where the rest of the tribe is.  I don’t seem to be able to pinpoint where they are.  I’m wondering how many other people are in this rest area.  Are they paying any attention to me?</p>
<p>I’m starting to feel self-conscious.  I’m not sure what to do with myself.  I’m not actually even sure what I <em>can</em> do with myself.</p>
<p>One of the quieter voices in our tribe speaks to me and asks me if I need anything.  Apparently there is someone else near me.  That feels reassuring.</p>
<p>I ask her about the layout of the rest stop.  She describes it and continues to answer some of my wonderings.  Melissa is over meeting dogs in the dog area of the rest stop.  I am indeed not sitting very near the tribe.  I’m sitting more near the restroom and apparently there are a lot of other people around, though not really paying much attention to me.</p>
<p>The voice leads me over to where the rest of the tribe is.  I sit back down on the grass.  I’m still not sure what to do with myself.  I sit still and listen to the sounds.</p>
<p>Melissa’s voice appears and tells me about the dogs that she met.  It’s good to hear her voice.  When our 15 minutes of break are up she leads me back to the van.</p>
<p>It feels good to be back in the van.  It’s the only place today that I’ve been to twice.  It’s comforting to return to a familiar place.  I feel less self-conscious because I’m doing the same thing as everyone else in the van.  Sitting.</p>
<p>I continue to feel awkward in joining conversations.  I notice that I’m starting to feel or notice more tension in my body.</p>
<p>I expected this to be a challenge.  I expected the challenge to come in the form of things I had to figure out how to do.  Like taking down my tarp.  That was challenging to find with my hands where everything was and get it into my bag.</p>
<p>Now I’m noticing a different challenge.  I don’t feel in control of my life.  When I’m outside the van, if I need something, someone else has to provide it for me.</p>
<p>I’d previously imagined what doing a blindfolded challenge would be like.  It was going to be in my house or some other place that I had a solid mental map of.  I would have the time and safety to experiment and bumble my way through things.</p>
<p>In contrast, here, today, I was part of a group of people hurtling across the country.  A blindfolded participant in a day of efficiently planned activities that did not include a blindfolded participant.</p>
<p>There was no place or time for me to experiment with or explore my own physical capabilities or incapabilities.  I could choose to explore what I could do on my own.  In so doing I would separate myself from the tribe as they went about their own explorations at a much faster pace.</p>
<p>Or I could choose to request that someone else share their capability with me.  They could keep me in the loop and help me move at the speed of the rest of the tribe.  Melissa was the only one I felt comfortable making this request of.  I didn’t feel comfortable making this request of her continually for the whole day.</p>
<p>When it’s time for lunch, we stop for at an In-and-Out Burger.  Melissa wants to go grab a coffee.  She leaves me her debit card (I can’t find my wallet) and a request for the cheeseburger she wants from In-and-Out.</p>
<p>I think I was imagining that she would get me food.  All of a sudden I don’t really want to figure out how to get myself in and out of the In-and-Out.  I don’t want to figure out how to order and eat food.  I’m overwhelmed.</p>
<p>I don’t want to take off my blindfold.  I want someone to help me.  I don’t want to ask anyone for help.  They have their own things they want to do.  They didn’t imagine they would be spending their day helping me.  I certainly didn’t ask them before hand if they were going to be willing to lead me through an In-and-Out burger blindfolded.</p>
<p>I’m standing outside the van.  People are quickly dispersing and I’m not sure who is going where or where the In-and-Out burger is, or how to get there.  Nick volunteers to take me to the In-and-Out burger.  I feel immense relief.</p>
<p>I’m more relieved at not having to ask for help than I am about being able to find burgers (though I am pretty excited about burgers).  I am also fully aware that Nick, a vegetarian, is making a sacrifice in helping me out.  He could easily be heading for a more vegetarian friendly eatery.</p>
<p>I feel a lot better knowing I’ll have a guide through this upcoming experience of ordering a burger blind.  I’m feeling a strange mix of fear from self-consciousness and excitement from the novelty of this.</p>
<p>Nick guides me through the parking lot to the In-and-Out.  The line is out the door.  I continue to feel self-conscious.  Now I’m worried about walking into people that I don’t know.</p>
<p>When we’re inside I can hear the sound of people talking and laughing and ordering and eating.  I can smell burgers and fries.  We slowly move forward in the line.</p>
<p>I move when Nick does.  I try to tell Nick a bit about what this experience is like but it’s hard to find the words.  Nick tells me what’s on the menu.</p>
<p>We get to the counter and I have no idea which way to face to talk to the cashier.  What do I usually say first in these situations?  I think I usually just place my order.  I’d like to be facing the person though.  Where are they? I’m overthinking this.</p>
<p>“Hello”, I say.</p>
<p>“Hello”, comes the response.</p>
<p>“I’d like to order a cheeseburger with regular fries and a bacon cheeseburger animal style”, I say, placing mine and Melissa’s order.</p>
<p>Such a normal thing to say.  I feel excruciatingly weird saying it into the inky blackness.  I wonder if this is weird for the cashier too?  Hopefully she gets a good story out of this.  She confirms my order without missing a beat and tells me the total.</p>
<p>I wait for a second and then realize she’s probably waiting for me to give her money.  I hand her Melissa’s card wondering if she’ll care that it’s clearly not my card.  She doesn’t seem to.</p>
<p>Nick grabs my hands and moves them to where she is trying to hand me back the receipt and the card.  She tells me my order number which I quickly forget.  I wait for Nick to order.</p>
<p>Nick guides me over to the soda station.  I feel the nozzles and levers.  Nick tells me which one is root beer.  I push the cup into the lever and hope soda isn’t going all over the floor.</p>
<p>Nick guides me to a place where I can hear many familiar voices.  This must be where the tribe is eating or waiting for their food.  It sounds like people are having a good time.</p>
<p>Nick tries to move me into a place where I can sit down.  I can’t easily figure it out.  I’m expecting a booth or at least something with a table.</p>
<p>Eventually I figure out that it’s just a chair or a bench and sit down.  Crap.  What was my order number?  Where’s my receipt?</p>
<p>I find a receipt-like piece of paper in my pocket.</p>
<p>“Can anyone read this?”, I ask.</p>
<p>Someone can.  They tell me my order number.  I forget it again. My brain is too overloaded.  I can’t remember anything.</p>
<p>Melissa returns with her coffee.  She finds my receipt and grabs the burgers when they are ready.  Saved.</p>
<p>Melissa leads me outside.  I can feel the warmth of the day and the heat of the sun.  I can hear more familiar voices.  We sit down at what I imagine is an octagonal table.  It has a familiar thick plasticized mesh structure.</p>
<p>I’m hungry and excited to eat.  I open the two boxes that contain my burger and fries.  The fries are a mass of gooey substance.  Oh right.  I ordered animal style.</p>
<p>The burger seems more manageable.  I decide to tackle that one first.  I pick it up and take my first bite.</p>
<p>It’s disgusting.</p>
<p>Huh.  It’s not that it doesn’t taste like a hamburger.  It does.  Sortof.  It tastes like a bland and gross meat-like substance smothered with a bland and gross sauce-like substance between two bland and gross bread like substances.</p>
<p>I don’t frequently eat at fast food places.  I don’t think that’s the issue though.  I usually find fast food places a bit of a guilty pleasure.  I’ve had an In-and-Out burger before and thought it was good.</p>
<p>It tastes enough like a burger that I don’t think someone swapped it out for some other non-burger thing.  It just tastes like a really bland burger.</p>
<p>I wonder if this has anything to do with not be able to see.  I’ve heard that fast food places use their colors to trigger hunger and desire.  I wonder how much the bright and delicious looking images affect the actual perceived deliciousness of the burger.</p>
<p>I have no idea.  But the reality remains that this burger does not taste like food.  I proceed to eat most of it.  I’d gone through a lot of stress to procure it after all.  There’s a lot of messy fun to be had eating blind.</p>
<p>The fries are worse.  I don’t eat many of those.  My root beer is delicious though.  I polish that one off.</p>
<p>Melissa doesn’t like her burger either.  Maybe this place just doesn’t make good burgers.</p>
<p>I’m feeling much less stressed.  Even with the gross burgers I’m enjoying this experience.  There is certainly a lot of fun and novelty to it.</p>
<p>It’s time to return to the vans.  Melissa guides me to a trash can.  I don’t want to touch it to figure out where to push in the flap.  I do.  It doesn’t have a flap.</p>
<p>It feels great to be back in the van.  I feel more relaxed returning to the known contours of the seat.  It feels safe and homey.  I feel satisfied with my burger experience.</p>
<p>I feel very appreciative of Nick and Melissa.  The question of whether or not other people would be willing to go out of their way to help me out is starting to be answered.  I can feel that some of the anxiety I was holding around that question is starting to fall away.</p>
<p>We make one more stop at a gas station before we get to our final destination.  I’m balancing on something like a metal balancing beam.  I think it’s about two feet off the ground but I’m not sure.</p>
<p>The voices of the tribe are running about around me.  It sounds like they are also balancing on random things, laughing, and participating in general shenanigans.</p>
<p>My balance wavers.  I reach out into the empty space.  A hand meets mine and I regain my balance.  I feel safe.</p>
<p>And I have no idea where in the world I am.</p>
<p>To be continued...</p>
